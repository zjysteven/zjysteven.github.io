I start my job as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Sciforium](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sciforium/posts/?feedView=all) today. As one of the founding team members, I will be developing the latest multi-modal LLMs and touching almost every aspect of the whole spectrum, including data curation, model development, training, and deployment.

I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Sciforium](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sciforium/posts/?feedView=all), focusing on the development latest multi-modal LLMs. Previously, I got my Ph.D. at Duke ECE where I have the honor to be advised by [Prof. Yiran Chen](https://cei.pratt.duke.edu/people/yiran-chen) and [Prof. Hai (Helen) Li](https://cei.pratt.duke.edu/people/hai-helen-li). I obtained my Bachelor degree in 2019 from the Department of Electronic Engineering at [Tsinghua University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsinghua_University). My dissertation research topics include adversarial machine learning and distributional shifts (specifically out-of-distribution detection). I have interned at Bosch Center for AI and Tesla over the summers.

I'm a big fan of open-source projects. Notably, I'm one of the main contributors to [OpenOOD](https://github.com/Jingkang50/OpenOOD), the largest (and arguably the most well-recognized) codebase for out-of-distribution detection (on image data). I also develop [lmms-finetune](https://github.com/zjysteven/lmms-finetune), a lightweight framework for fine-tuning a variety of vision LLMs on custom data.

I write technical blogs from time to time. You can find them on [Medium](https://medium.com/@zhjy227) and [知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/people/zhang-jing-yang-54/posts).

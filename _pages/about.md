I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at Duke University in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I'm advised by [Prof. Yiran Chen](https://cei.pratt.duke.edu/people/yiran-chen) and [Prof. Hai (Helen) Li](https://cei.pratt.duke.edu/people/hai-helen-li). I obtained my Bachelor degree in 2019 from Department of Electronic Engineering at [Tsinghua University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsinghua_University). My research topics include adversarial machine learning and distributional shifts (specifically out-of-distribution detection). I have interned at Bosch Center for AI and Tesla over the summers.

I write technical blogs from time to time. You can find them on [Medium](https://medium.com/@zhjy227) and [知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/people/zhang-jing-yang-54/posts).

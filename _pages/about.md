I'm current a Ph.D. candidate at Duke University in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I'm advised by [Prof. Yiran Chen](https://cei.pratt.duke.edu/people/yiran-chen) and [Prof. Hai (Helen) Li](https://cei.pratt.duke.edu/people/hai-li). I obtained my Bachelor degree in 2019 from Tsinghua University. My research topics include adversarial machine learning and distributional shifts (specifically out-of-distribution detection). I have interned at Bosch Center for AI and Tesla over the summers.
